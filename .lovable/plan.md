Shift Coin Protocol Overview

"Shift is NOT a cryptocurrency - it's a revolutionary mining protocol"

How It Works: Encrypted device fingerprinting technology that collects and encrypts device data (IP, VPN, IMEI, MAC, GPS, Bluetooth, WiFi, DNS), then uses mathematical algorithms to mine Reality Coins
Key Innovation: Automatically selects the fastest, cheapest blockchain network with ZERO or minimal gas fees
First-of-its-kind: World's First Shift Mining Protocol
Reality Coin (RC)

Always $1 Stable Value inside LTReality network
Supply Cap: 365 Trillion
Becomes volatile only when converted OUT to external networks
4-Year Crypto Lock for platform stability
Miracle Coin (MC)

Premium conversion target: $1 Million per coin
Supply Cap: 777 Trillion
Conversion: Accumulate 1 Million RC = 1 MC, OR spend $2 Million in transactions = 1 MC
RC recirculates after conversion
